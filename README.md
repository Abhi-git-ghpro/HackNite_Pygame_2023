## Installation

This is a game built in in python's pygame module. Hence you would need python3 and pygame installed on your device

On your Linux device,
to install python3 please use the command:
```bash
  pip install python3
```
To install pygame please use the command:
```bash
  pip install pygame
```
Now please download all the files in zip format from this repository. Extract and save in a fresh folder.

Navigate in the folder.
```bash
  cd <folder_name>
```
Navigate in the folder shown below.
```bash
  cd HackNite_Pygame_2023-main
```

Check if all the game files of the repository are present there.
Use the command:
```bash
  ls
```
If you followed all the steps till now, you should see 4 directories.

Next, navigate to the directory "code":
```bash
  cd code
```
The setup is now finished. To run the game please use the command:
```bash

## Technologies used

- Tiled:-Tiled is a free and open source, easy to use, and      flexible level editor. Used for map and map objects creation.
- Python's pygame module:- Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Used for building this project.
- Python's os and sys module:-Project uses os.walk() and sys.exit()
- Microsoft Paint:- For editing the game sprites and background.
- Git and Github:- Used for version control.
- Python's csv module:- Tiled .tmx was converted into .csv files. Hence this module was used to read them.



## Challenges Faced
- Sprites and sounds:- The very first challenge for making this game was to get the desired sprites with correct format and animation.We spent a long time browsing the sprites. Same goes with sounds. Unfortunately, we didn't end up getting all the desired sprites.
- Tiled :- Using the .csv files created from Tiled to construct the map for the game using pygame.
- AI for enemies:- We faced a hard time building and implementing logic for the zombie attack, animation and tracing_player actions.
- File management:- Managing different files and folders for code , graphics, sounds, code_related files was a tedious task.
Many a times we ended up getting import related errors and file_not_found errors during execution.
- Object_oriented programming:- For making the game possible, we had to use intensive Object_oriented programming which was challenging.
- Using git ang github:- This was one of the hardest tasks during the development. Some of the challenges we faced doing this was :

  "Divergent branches":- They used to happen frequently.

  "pycache":- This keeps getting modified.

  "tempCodeRunner.py" :- The source of its creation is unknown  to us.

  "Losing a lot hard work due to one of the git errors"
